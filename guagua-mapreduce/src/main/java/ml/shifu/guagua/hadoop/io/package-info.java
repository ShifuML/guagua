/**
 * This package contains hadoop related common io classes.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Noticed that each class in this package is the same package and same name with the one in guagua-yarn. This is
 * important to make sure such common hadoop io utils can be used in both guagua mapreduce and yarn implementations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * IO related classes including {@link ml.shifu.guagua.hadoop.io.GuaguaWritableAdapter} and
 * {@link ml.shifu.guagua.hadoop.io.GuaguaWritableSerializer} can be used to combine hadoop
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.io.Writable} with guagua {@link ml.shifu.guagua.io.Bytable}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Hadoop input format and output format customization for guagua is in
 * {@link ml.shifu.guagua.mapreduce.GuaguaInputFormat} and {@link ml.shifu.guagua.mapreduce.GuaguaOutputFormat} and
 * other related classes.
